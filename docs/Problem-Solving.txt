Visitor
Through the use of the visitor design pattern we were able to create a program where the core functionality is not directly connected to the classes being used. Instead of lumping both class variables and functions together, we have detatched the functionality in a way that is extensible and easy to refactor. Because the functionality is located within the ElementVisitor class, new functionality can be added more easily to a wider array of objects without risking breaking the system.
